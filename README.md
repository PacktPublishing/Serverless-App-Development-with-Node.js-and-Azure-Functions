## About the Video Course
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Azure Functions are Microsoft's answer to Serverless computing, and help you run code easily in the cloud; you can write code and not worry about the infrastructure required to run it. 
This course will show you how to build a serverless app with Node.js and Azure Functions. Using Functions, you will easily build the apps you need using simple, serverless functions that scale to meet demand. Build an ecommerce application from creation to deployment and practice saving data to Azure Cosmos DB, which prompts Azure Functions output and input integration. You will see how to integrate Azure functions with SendGrid and process notification emails and also see how to integrate Stripe JS payment portal to our application. Finally you will handle continuous deployment using Azure App Services.
By the end of the course, you will have built your own serverless application with Node.js and Azure Functions using simple, serverless functions that scale to meet demand.
